**Snapshot date context:** after Phase 15A (Vocabulary Enrichment Data Model).

## Product

**StudyGuard / langstudyguard** is a Windows desktop study-lock app that helps a learner practice vocabulary (and optional reading) before dismissing a locked fullscreen session.

- **Stack:** Python + Tkinter desktop client
- **Account server:** Hetzner VPS; domain `langstudyguard.com`
- **Distribution:** GitHub Releases (`langstudyguard.zip` / `.exe`); unsigned binary (SmartScreen friction known)
- **ScreenGuard / startup lock:** works and must remain untouched unless an explicit phase says otherwise
- **AI:** production requests go through the account server; OpenAI production key must never be embedded in the desktop executable

### Study languages (canonical registry)

`nl`, `en`, `fr`, `de`, `es`, `it`, `pt`

Dutch (`nl`) is the historical default for some compatibility paths — core architecture must not assume Dutch.

### UI / native languages

`vi`, `en` — distinct from study language.

Major UI surfaces: Home Dashboard, Vocabulary Library + Word Detail, Mistake Book, study session (quiz + optional reading).

## Persistence (local, per study language)

Typical layout under AppData language folders:

| File | Role | Identity / notes |
|------|------|------------------|
| `vocab.json` | Vocabulary entries | Stable UUID `id`; lexical + optional enrichment |
| `progress.json` | Aggregate learning + SRS | **version 3**, words keyed by vocab UUID; `legacy_index` for compat |
| `attempts.jsonl` | Append-oriented attempt events | Prefer `vocab_id`; `word` is historical snapshot |
| `settings.json` | App/settings | Native language, study languages, activities, etc. |

### Canonical lexical fields

```text
id, word, meaning,
alternatives?, part_of_speech?, note?,
examples?, pronunciation?, forms?
```

Enrichment (Phase 15A — storage only, not auto-filled):

- `examples`: `[{text, meaning?}, ...]`
- `pronunciation`: `{ipa}` when present
- `forms`: subset of `plural` / `past` / `past_participle` / `comparative` / `superlative`

Legacy read still supported: `vi`, `alt`, `type`, `nl`, `en`, string `example`. New writes use canonical fields. Account HTTP wire may still send `vi` — that is **not** the local canonical field.

## Current test commands

```text
python -m pytest
python app/smoke_test.py
```

**Baseline snapshot (not a permanent invariant):** after Phase 15A, **177 pytest tests passing**; smoke test all checks pass.

## Current development position

```text
Completed: Phase 14 — Vocabulary Model v2
Completed: Phase 14.5 — Project Memory Foundation
Completed: Phase 15A — Vocabulary Enrichment Data Model
Next: Phase 15B — enrichment providers / review flow (not started)
```

Phase 15A adds storage/domain capability only. It does **not** automatically enrich vocabulary.
